# 🧠 My Code Dairy

This repository serves as a **public record of continuous development and learning** — a place where I document my progress, experiments, and challenges as I grow as a developer.

## 📝 Automated Contributions (GitHub Actions)

During focused study periods (for example, during university exam preparation), I’ve configured a **GitHub Actions workflow** to maintain a consistent activity streak and keep this repository active.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This automation is **not** an attempt to “cheat” GitHub contributions.  
> It simply logs regular updates as a **health check** to show that learning and self-development remain ongoing — even when hands-on coding is temporarily paused for academic reasons.

### 🔧 Automation Details
- **Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/daily_streak.yml`  
- **Purpose:** Automatically appends a timestamped entry to `commit_log.md` several times a day.  
- **Schedule:** Runs **four times daily** (UTC) — aligned with morning, afternoon, and evening in **Bangladesh Standard Time (BDT)**.  
- **Transparency:**  
  You can freely review the workflow file for complete visibility into how it operates.
